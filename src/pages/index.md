Hi, I'm Mai. As a third-year BSc student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, majoring in Information and Communication Technology, with a solid foundation in information security and hands-on experience in web security, I am eager to deepen my understanding of how to defend systems against real-world threats. In the near term, I hope to work in a Pentest/Red Team role, as it closely matches both my current skill set and my strong interest in offensive security. At the same time, I want to actively learn from Blue Team perspectives and practices, so that I can build a more well-rounded knowledge base and develop more objective, informed judgments when analyzing, attacking, and helping to secure systems in a professional environment.
